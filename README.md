strace-analyzer
---------------

Analyzes [strace][] output. Currently, the following analysis commands are provided:

- **summary** short summary
- **read** per file read summary
- **write** per file write summary
- **io** does both **read** and **write**

File descriptors are associated with file names. The association is made when syscalls like
**open**, **creat**, **dup** or **pipe** are read from the log and the association gets terminated
when they get **close**d.

Pre-built packages can be downloaded from the [GitHub releases page][releases].

building
--------

build dependencies:

- [jdk][]
- [sbt][]

```bash
git clone -b master git://github.com/wookietreiber/strace-analyzer.git
cd strace-analyzer
sbt stage
export PATH="$PWD/target/universal/stage/bin:$PATH"
```

usage
-----

```bash
# create logs
strace -T -ttt -ff -o app-strace.log app

# analyze logs (command defines how they are analyzed)
strace-analyzer command app-strace.log.*

# pipelining, ignore the useless use of cat, this is just an example ;-)
cat app-strace.log.27049 | strace-analyzer read | column -t
```

More help can be gotten via:

```bash
strace-analyzer --help
```

caveats
-------

-   does only work with traces created with the usage example above, there is no support for logs
    that contain output of multiple process ids

-   does not parse unfinished / resumed entries, single-threaded application runs are recommended or
    else you are going to miss a lot of entries

issues, features, use-cases, wish list
--------------------------------------

-   If you think of a new (possibly high-level) analysis use case or how to improve an existing one,
    please [open an issue][newissue]. If you have an idea on how the output should look like, feel
    free to include a sketch of an example.

-   If you recognize missing file associations in the output, i.e. bare file descriptor numbers
    without a note as to why it could not be identified, please [open an issue][newissue] and
    provide access to that particular, complete strace log, so I am able to identify the problem.

    If you know that a particular file should be included, because you know that file has been
    opened, it would be of great help if you would name these files in the issue.

features that will not be implemented
-------------------------------------

In the spirit of the Unix philosohpy of **do one thing and do it well**, strace-analyzer will **not** do
any of the following:

-   *filtering*, use tools like [grep][] or [awk][], e.g.:

        strace-analyzer read strace.log.1835 | grep scala
        strace-analyzer read strace.log.1835 | awk '/scala/'

-   *sorting*, use the [sort][] command line utility, e.g.:

        strace-analyzer read strace.log.27049 | sort -h -k 2

-   pretty *tabular output* printing, use the [column][] command line utility, e.g.:

        strace-analyzer read strace.log.27049 | column -t
